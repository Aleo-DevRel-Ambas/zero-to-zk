# InclusionProof
Inclusion proofs are like a special handshake or password that gets you past verifier without revealing the actual element.

In Aleo inclusion proofs are like digital receipts that verify transactions without compromising users privacy.

In general, inclusion proofs are a part of Merkle tree data structures, which are used in cryptographic systems to efficiently prove that a piece of data is part of a set of data. An inclusion proof, in this context, is a proof that a certain element is included in a set without revealing the entire set.
