# zkCloud
zkCloud is the infrastructure that allows Aleo to enable decentralized private computations. This infrastructure is made up of two parts, `snarkVM` - zero knowledge off chain execution client and `snarkOS` which is the network client that verifies that off chain computation has been done correctly by verifying the `zksnark` that has been submitted.

Together `snarkVM` and `snarkOS` allow individuals to remain private and use this off chain computation to interact with a given decentralized application (program) on Aleo. On the other hand it also enables developers to create these privacy preserving decentralized applications through using leo or aleo instructions and deploying the program to the network.
