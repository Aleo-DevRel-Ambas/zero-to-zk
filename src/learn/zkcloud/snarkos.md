# SnarkOS

>SnarkOS is a decentralized operating system for zero-knowledge applications. This code forms the backbone of Aleo network, which verifies transactions and stores the encrypted state of applications in a publicly-verifiable manner.

The network client has to take care of verifying the transactions computed off chain using snarkvm, allowing all snarkOS nodes to reach consensus and to store the private and non private state in Aleo's distributed ledger.
