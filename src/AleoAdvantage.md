# Aleo vs Competitors

**Privacy by Default:** Unlike other blockchains where privacy features need to be added, Aleo builds privacy directly into its core. This means developers don't have to spend extra effort making their applications private, allowing them to focus on functionality.

**Developer Friendly:** Aleo offers a Rust-based programming language called Leo, specifically designed for building ZK-private applications. Leo includes an online IDE (LeoPlayground) and uses zkSNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge) to streamline development of privacy-focused dApps.

**General-Purpose Programmability:** While some ZK blockchains focus on specific use cases like private transactions, Aleo allows developers to create a wider variety of applications with different assets, all on the same ledger. This opens doors for more innovative use cases.
